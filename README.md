# Data-analysis-projects

Here, I present data analysis and visualization projects aimed at extracting actionable insights from business data. My work demonstrates the use of advanced SQL for deep data analysis, paired with Tableau to deliver interactive, storytelling dashboards that reveal trends, insights, and performance metrics effectively.

**1. Customer Shopping Segmentation**

**Goal:** Identify and understand various customer segments and shopping behaviors.

**SQL Analysis:** Performed in Microsoft SQL, focusing on in-depth customer insights, transaction frequency, and segmentation based on demographic and purchase patterns. This project utilizes a wide range of SQL techniques, including aggregation, filtering, and grouping, to extract key insights that can help businesses tailor their marketing and sales strategies.

**Data Storytelling with Tableau:** Built a dynamic dashboard that not only visualizes customer segments but also highlights shopping trends and behaviors across various demographics. Interactive features provide stakeholders with easy-to-understand insights, allowing them to track customer behaviors and improve targeted marketing strategies.

**2. Superstore Sales Performance Analysis**

**Goal:** Analyze and evaluate sales performance and profitability metrics at a granular level.

**SQL Analysis:** Using advanced SQL queries, I analyzed sales trends, profitability, customer loyalty, and performance across different regions and product categories. This project dives into complex SQL functions to reveal performance drivers and highlight potential areas for operational efficiency and growth.

**Interactive Visualization with Tableau:** Created an interactive dashboard that displays regional performance, sales trends, and customer purchase patterns. The dashboard incorporates best practices for data visualization, such as clear layout, color schemes for readability, and intuitive drill-down options for detailed analysis.
