# Data-analysis-projects

Here, I present data analysis and visualization projects aimed at extracting actionable insights from business data. My work demonstrates the use of advanced SQL for deep data analysis, paired with Tableau to deliver interactive, storytelling dashboards that reveal trends, insights, and performance metrics effectively.

**1. HR Analysis**

**Goal:** Analyze HR data to derive actionable insights about employee demographics, performance, and compensation trends.

**Tableau Workflow:** 

Data Connection and Exploration: I began by downloading a free HR dataset and connecting it to Tableau. After checking data quality, I explored the dataset fields such as age, gender, salary, performance scores, and education levels to understand relationships and trends.

Data Preparation: The dataset was refined by creating calculated fields (e.g., total_hired, salary, status) and organizing dimensions and measures for analysis.

Based on the analysis requirements, I created a variety of charts to highlight insights effectively:

BANs (Big-Ass Numbers): For high-level KPIs like total employees, average salary, and performance ratings.

Line Charts: To analyze salary trends or performance over time.

Bar Charts: To show gender distribution and salary by education levels.

Maps: For geographical representation of employee demographics .

Pie Charts: For a breakdown of gender or education level proportions.

Heatmaps: To compare age/education across performance ratings.

Scatter Plots: Distribution of measures .

I first sketched the dashboard layout to ensure a logical flow of information. Then, I assembled the charts and added interactivity through filters and actions. The final dashboard delivered a cohesive and visually engaging story about HR metrics.

**2. Superstore Sales Performance Analysis**

**Goal:** Analyze and evaluate sales performance and profitability metrics at a granular level.

**SQL Analysis:** Using advanced SQL queries, I analyzed sales trends, profitability, customer loyalty, and performance across different regions and product categories. This project dives into complex SQL functions to reveal performance drivers and highlight potential areas for operational efficiency and growth.

**Interactive Visualization with Tableau:** Created an interactive dashboard that displays regional performance, sales trends, and customer purchase patterns. The dashboard incorporates best practices for data visualization, such as clear layout, color schemes for readability, and intuitive drill-down options for detailed analysis.

**3. Customer Shopping Segmentation**

**Goal:** Identify and understand various customer segments and shopping behaviors.

**SQL Analysis:** Performed in Microsoft SQL, focusing on in-depth customer insights, transaction frequency, and segmentation based on demographic and purchase patterns. This project utilizes a wide range of SQL techniques, including aggregation, filtering, and grouping, to extract key insights that can help businesses tailor their marketing and sales strategies.

**Data Storytelling with Tableau:** Built a dynamic dashboard that not only visualizes customer segments but also highlights shopping trends and behaviors across various demographics. Interactive features provide stakeholders with easy-to-understand insights, allowing them to track customer behaviors and improve targeted marketing strategies.
